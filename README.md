A Circuit sim made by someone who doesn't know a lick of circuitry.

## How to run

```sh
cd scripts

./backend.bat
./frontend.bat
```
The web server will be started on port `8080`




## What does each folder do?


* The `scripts` folder contains your scripts to run and build each process.

* The `backend` folder contains the web server Rust code.
*
* The `common` folder contains code which is used on both the backend and frontend.

* The `frontend` folder contains front end Rust code.
